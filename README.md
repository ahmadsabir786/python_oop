# Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure code. Python supports OOP principles, making it easier to write reusable and modular code.

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the mechanism of restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent accidental modification of data. This is achieved using private and protected access modifiers.

### Key Points:
- Encapsulation helps in data hiding and abstraction.
- It restricts direct access to variables and methods.
- Provides getter and setter methods for controlled access.

## Inheritance
Inheritance is a feature that allows one class (child) to inherit the properties and behavior of another class (parent). It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.

### Key Points:
- Allows a class to reuse the functionality of another class.
- Supports different types of inheritance such as single, multiple, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance.
- Helps in reducing code duplication.

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions.

### Key Points:
- Allows methods to have the same name but behave differently based on the object.
- Achieved using method overriding and method overloading (though Python doesn't support true method overloading).
- Provides flexibility and scalability in designing programs.
